**American Foreign Policy Research**

The purpose of this github repository is to research American Foreign Policy and take a data-driven view into what determines who America deems an ally or an adversary. Obviously there has been a lot of back and forth about what drives American Foreign Policy. Is it something high-minded and benevolent? Or is it a fantatical devotion to a particular ideology? Is it greed and/or self-preservation? I intend to rigorously find a model that best fits the data.
